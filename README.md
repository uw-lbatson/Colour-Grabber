# Python-Color-Grab

This is a python application that 'grabs' the css3 color of whatever you hover your cursor over. 

Both versions, the console only and tkinter application are added.

The application works using pyautogui, Pillow, and webcolors modules. The application gets the pixel the cursor is on, and returns the most prominant color the pixel contains.
The application is run on python 3.7+
